# DiscordMusicPlaylists
### This is an Amateur code for a discord bot which can store music playlists for you. On calling a single command you can view your stored playlists or your friend's playlists.

PS: I am very new to discord python, and just experimenting with my skills. If you feel any changes regarding my code or anything in general please do suggest. Thank You!!
